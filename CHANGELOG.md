Starting from Version 1.37.4, documenting important changes to the codebase.

## 1.37.4

-  Added backwards compatibility with the old managed policy value "whitelist_top_domains".  

Please move away from using "whitelist_top_domains" immediately.  Backwards compatibility may be removed shortly.
The replacement value is "allowlist_top_domains".
